# menu2html
Tool to scrape the Hanssens Catering menu and convert it to a basic webpage (for use with Xibo dispay). Based on my menu2rss project, but with some nice clean html/css instead of rss to display the results...
## To use
1. Go to hanssens and find your menu link that is structured like this: https://order.hanssens.be/menu/[menu-code]/[school-name]
2. Replace the url on line 17 of menu2html.py
3. Run the python script
